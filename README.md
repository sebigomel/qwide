<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

As a developer, in any project I started I was always seeking for an appropiate template without any success. This is why I decided to build this to help the community. 

Here's why you should use it:
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. Not in setting up a project and installing libraries
* It makes use of JWTs and cookies to securely store user's sensitive info
* It's built for the MERN stack, which has grown in popularity over the las couple of years

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have contributed to expanding this template!
